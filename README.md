## Overview

### Specifications

Because this my own project I made his without technical specification, but I had a few theses.

1. The SignIn form should be similar to Retro Radio. I used reference from pinterest for this.
2. Validation of the correct input of the email and password must be implemented.
3. There must be visual changes when entering correctly.

## My process

### Built with

- BEM
- SASS | mixin, variables, import
- JS
- Git

### What I learned

This is project was my first experience realization own idea.

1. I have imroved my knowledge in using SASS (variables and mixins).
2. I tried to use BEM, but this is far from ideal.
3. For the first time, I changed the webkit parameters to remove unwanted changes related to input autofill

### Continued development

My development plans:

- More SASS
- Multiple page sites
- Consolidate knowledge about functions in js. Understand to work of recursions.
- Start working with the API
- Will learn git in detail and start working with the console
